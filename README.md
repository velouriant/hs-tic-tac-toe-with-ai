Hyperskill Project: Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

### Description from HS
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or X's and O's. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it's simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and create an AI opponent to do battle with!

### Overview of features

Start game by inputting command "start [user / easy / medium / hard] [user / easy / medium / hard]"

Finish by inputting "exit"

Game has three AI modes:

1. Easy - Which randomly chooses a cell to play its next turn
2. Medium - Which checks whether there is a move available to win for itself or the other player and plays accordingly
3. Hard - Which uses recursive search, and minimax, to brute force solve the best possible play from any given position. Should not be beatable.

Focus in coding was on functional decomposition to create a well structured program
